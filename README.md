# 🧠 Simon Says Game – Frontend JavaScript Project

A **classic Simon Says memory game** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, focusing on **game logic, event handling, and state management**.  
This project demonstrates how interactive browser-based games work using **pure frontend technologies**, without any external libraries, frameworks, or assets.

## ✨ Project Overview

The Simon Says Game challenges the player to **memorize and repeat an increasing sequence of colors**.  
With each level, the sequence grows longer, testing the player’s **memory, focus, and reaction accuracy**.

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> This is a **frontend-only project** with **no backend, APIs, audio files, or external assets**.  
> All visuals and interactions are handled using core web technologies.
